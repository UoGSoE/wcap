{"id":"wcap-qj4.2","title":"Trend analysis with charts","description":"Add visual trend analysis using flux:chart components to help managers identify patterns over longer periods.\n\n## Potential Charts\n- Occupancy over time (line chart per location)\n- Average utilisation comparison across locations (bar chart)\n- Peak vs average occupancy trends\n\n## Context\nCurrently the heatmap auto-aggregates to weekly for large date ranges, but visual charts would make trends more immediately apparent.\n\n## User thoughts\nI think this could be it's own new tab on the occupancy page.  If we re-use the existing date range from the heatmap and stats tabs - but also add a `\u003cflux:checkbox.group wire:model=\"locations\" label=\"Locations\" variant=\"pills\"\u003e` (it's a nice flux component visually) which lets the user select/unselect specific locations (we should include them all as 'checked' by default).  \n\nFlux supports a multi-line chart.
