{"id":"wcap-qj4.2","title":"Trend analysis with charts","description":"Add visual trend analysis using flux:chart components to help managers identify patterns over longer periods.\n\n## Potential Charts\n- Occupancy over time (line chart per location)\n- Average utilisation comparison across locations (bar chart)\n- Peak vs average occupancy trends\n\n## Context\nCurrently the heatmap auto-aggregates to weekly for large date ranges, but visual charts would make trends more immediately apparent.\n\n## User thoughts\nI think this could be it's own new tab on the occupancy page.  If we re-use the existing date range from the heatmap and stats tabs - but also add a `\u003cflux:checkbox.group wire:model=\"locations\" label=\"Locations\" variant=\"pills\"\u003e` (it's a nice flux component visually) which lets the user select/unselect specific locations (we should include them all as 'checked' by default).  \n\nFlux supports a multi-line chart.  An example from their docs is :\n\n```blade\n\u003cflux:chart wire:model=\"data\"\u003e\n    \u003cflux:chart.viewport class=\"min-h-[20rem]\" \u003e\n        \u003cflux:chart.svg\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.line field=\"twitter\" class=\"text-blue-500\" curve=\"none\" /\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.point field=\"twitter\" class=\"text-blue-500\" r=\"6\" stroke-width=\"3\" /\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.line field=\"facebook\" class=\"text-red-500\" curve=\"none\" /\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.point field=\"facebook\" class=\"text-red-500\" r=\"6\" stroke-width=\"3\" /\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.line field=\"instagram\" class=\"text-green-500\" curve=\"none\" /\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.point field=\"instagram\" class=\"text-green-500\" r=\"6\" stroke-width=\"3\" /\u003e\n\n            \u003cflux:chart.axis axis=\"x\" field=\"date\"\u003e\n                \u003cflux:chart.axis.tick /\u003e\n                \u003cflux:chart.axis.line /\u003e\n            \u003c/flux:chart.axis\u003e\n\n            \u003cflux:chart.axis axis=\"y\" tick-start=\"0\" tick-end=\"1\" :format=\"[\n                'style' =\u003e 'percent',\n                'minimumFractionDigits' =\u003e 0,\n                'maximumFractionDigits' =\u003e 0,\n            ]\"\u003e\n                \u003cflux:chart.axis.grid /\u003e\n                \u003cflux:chart.axis.tick /\u003e\n            \u003c/flux:chart.axis\u003e\n        \u003c/flux:chart.svg\u003e\n    \u003c/flux:chart.viewport\u003e\n\n    \u003cdiv class=\"flex justify-center gap-4 pt-4\"\u003e\n        \u003cflux:chart.legend label=\"Instagram\"\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.legend.indicator class=\"bg-green-400\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/flux:chart.legend\u003e\n\n        \u003cflux:chart.legend label=\"Twitter\"\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.legend.indicator class=\"bg-blue-400\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/flux:chart.legend\u003e\n\n        \u003cflux:chart.legend label=\"Facebook\"\u003e\n            \u003cflux:chart.legend.indicator class=\"bg-red-400\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/flux:chart.legend\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/flux:chart\u003e\n```\n\nAnd this is an example of the data structure:\n```php\nuse Livewire\\Component;\n\nclass Dashboard extends Component\n{\n    public array $data = [\n        ['date' =\u003e '2026-01-07', 'visitors' =\u003e 267],\n        ['date' =\u003e '2026-01-06', 'visitors' =\u003e 259],\n        ['date' =\u003e '2026-01-05', 'visitors' =\u003e 269],\n        // ...\n    ];\n}\n```\n\nThe `field='visitors'` is how we map the location name for each line.
