## Purpose

WCAP is a two-week planning tool used by an IT team to capture who is working, what they’re focusing on, and where they will be located. It is designed for staff to quickly update their plans and for managers to view team and service coverage. The key problem it solves is giving managers clear visibility into staffing and service coverage while keeping planning lightweight for individual team members.

## Tech Stack

Laravel 12, PHP 8.4, flux, flux-pro

## Features (from tests)

• Plan individual work and availability over a rolling two‑week window with quick create, update, and copy actions  
• View team coverage by location and notes to understand who is working, where, and on what, across the next 10 weekdays  
• Filter and tailor coverage views by role and team (including multi‑team managers and admins) to see exactly the staff group needed  
• Accurately represent availability in coverage views by excluding unavailable staff from counts and adjusting how they appear in team/location views  
• Configure personal planning defaults in user profiles so new entries prefill preferred locations, notes, and availability  
• Access and manage personal and administrative API tokens, with scoped visibility and revoke controls based on role  
• Integrate external tools via a documented API to read and modify plan data, including bulk create/update and location lookup  
• Manage services and their membership, including creating, editing, deleting, and reassigning members between services  
• Monitor service availability across all 10 weekdays, showing per‑service staffing counts, manager presence, and zero‑coverage scenarios  
• Manage users and their lifecycle, including creation, role changes, staff status updates, deletion, and cleanup of related data  
• Manage teams and team composition, including creating teams, editing details, assigning members, and handling member transfers on deletion
